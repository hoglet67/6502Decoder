/**
 * \short USB Device representation. 
 * \author Wolfgang Wieser ] wwieser (a) gmx <*> de [
 * 
 * The WWUSBDevice represents an USB device which can have several endpoints 
 * and communication in both directions (IN and OUT). 
 * 
 * The idea is to derive a class from this one and override some virtual 
 * functions to actually implement USB communication. 
 * 
 * NOTE: You canNOT use libusb routines in order to talk to a device while 
 *       having it opened using WWUSBDevice. Even not if the libusb code is 
 *       talking to a different endpoint of the device. The reason is that 
 *       libusb is likely to reap URBs which were submitted by us and vice 
 *       versa. So, be sure to know what you're doing. 
 * 
 * Not thread-safe. Only one thread should to all the USB actions. Otherwise 
 * a synchronisation layer must be added. 
 * 
 * Not "C++-safe", i.e. do not copy or assign; corresponding operators are 
 * made private by purpose.

		 * 
		 * URB handling is somewhat ciritcal since we want little overhead 
		 * and hence need to be careful with buffer allocation to avoid 
		 * spurious copying. 
		 * 
		 * So, it works as follows: URBs are allocated via operator new 
		 * and deleted via operator delete. URBs are always allocated from 
		 * user code and then get an apropriate buffer attached. Deallocation 
		 * from within WWUSBDevice is done via WWUSBDevice::DeleteURB() which 
		 * can be overridden to provide URB caching, see below. Note that 
		 * kernel copies the URB data buffer of OUT URBs upon submission so 
		 * buffer re-use is possible. The URB destructor must be able to 
		 * correctly deallocate an attached buffer so that the URB 
		 * cancellation code does not introducing a mem leak when deleting 
		 * a pending URB. 
		 * 
		 * Note that it is recommended to use URB caching to avoid 
		 * (de)allocation overhead. For that, implement custom operators 
		 * for new and delete: Operator new dequeues the memory chunk from 
		 * a list and operator delete will put it back (after the destructor 
		 * has been called). To make sure that the correct operators are 
		 * called, WWUSBDevice uses WWUSBDevice::DeleteURB() for URB deletion 
		 * which should be overridden with a "delete" statement first applying 
		 * the apropriate type cast.
